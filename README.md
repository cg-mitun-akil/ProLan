# ProLan
A Quiz game
ProLan – Guess the correct Programming Language!

In the game of ProLan, the compiler chooses a question (in the form of a object) at random from a given file and represents the answer using the special character ‘*’. The user then tries to guess the word, by guessing one letter at a time. Whenever the user guesses a letter that is in the answer, all occurrences of that letter are revealed to the user. The user is also provided with a limited number of lives.  For every error one life is deducted. The game ends when the user has guessed every letter in the word, before he reaches the allowed number of strikes.
